# Architecture

This section describes the architecture of the HOPE Documents project.

## Overview

HOPE Documents is a Django application designed for document processing and OCR. It is structured into several key components:

-   **`hope_documents.archive`**: A Django app that seems to be responsible for storing and managing documents. It includes Django models, admin configurations, and migrations.

-   **`hope_documents.ocr`**: This is the core component for OCR processing. It contains:
    -   `engine.py`: The main OCR engine, likely using Tesseract and OpenCV.
    -   `__cli__.py`: Implements the command-line interface for batch processing.
    -   `loaders.py`: Likely responsible for loading documents from different sources.
    -   `reader.py`: Reads the content of the documents.

-   **`hope_documents.utils`**: A collection of utility modules for common tasks such as image manipulation, language detection, logging, and performance timing.

## Technologies

-   **Backend Framework**: Django
-   **OCR Engine**: Tesseract, with image processing capabilities provided by OpenCV.
-   **Command-Line Interface**: Click
